#+TITLE: Curating Important Artifacts

* Artifact Repository Manager

"Artifact" is an overloaded term. I think of an /artifact/ as a single-file
resource that is the product of some build of some project. They are typically
binaries, like `jar`s for the JVM or native binaries built with `go build` or
`cargo build`. Even interpreted languages usually specify a single-file package
format, which may just be a bunch of source code zipped up into one file with
some metadata (like a python `pip` packages build with =sdist=). These
single-file things are "artifacts".

An Artifact Repository Manager stores artifacts so that you have them all in one
place. A good ARM will know the protocols of popular package managers, so that
you can store javascript packages in an NPM repo and =npm install= them, or
store =.deb= artifacts in a =deb= repo and =apt-get install= them, etc.

Some artifacts are more important than others.
